# Snowglobe Demo

The demo will show a real world simulation to demonstrate the power of Snowglobe state syncronization. The demo utilizes RapierJS as the physics engine, but uses a mock network
so that the demonstration can run in a single browser window.

## Quick Start

At the top level directory for Snowglobe run:

```
npm run example:demo
```
